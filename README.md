  ### Description:
      While the path is still long, the reluctant traveler thinks the journey is nearing the halfway marker.  This gives him a little hope, but he realizes that the harder struggles are usually reserved for the end.  Just as this thought was passing, a gust of wind blew and the trees made a howling sound as the invisible breeze blew in a harsh stench.  A lone parchment raced towards him being hurried by the wind.  SPLAT!  right on the face.  He moaned and wondered how this happens as the only living thing for miles, a note somehow smashes right into his face.  He pull the paper down and it revealed a cry for help.  
      
      He closed his eyes and wished he could simply ignore the quests that his tired life was being presented.  What misery awaits he pondered.  He was certain it would test his skills.  Begrudgingly, he opened his eyes and began to read.  It looked like someone needed a Command Line Application that would conjure a site that would store all the information needed for them to contact everyone with whom they worked.  "Why did everyone always want magic?", he grumbled.  He realized this would be faster for them, but more work for him.  

      He set to work summoning the dark arts to build something from nothing.  He knew that each part would need to be tested in Jest.  Why that was funny he did not know, but he imported all the npms that would be needed including jest and inquirer.
      The program was written in javascript and would generate an html page.  This was done with questions brought by the inquisitor.  Once he had the answers, they were passed like a haunting spell to other files and the ghoulish forms started to arise.  It was a thing of beauty as the red and black mist swirled about.  The shapes started to materialize and come into their true forms.  The spell had worked!   

      Alas, the time for tests drew near.  The traveler wasn't as familar with testing as he would like since trials were things that he wanted to avoid, so a simple test was performed on each of the conjured phantoms and roles were checked to make sure that they knew what they should be. By some stroke of luck, it was clear to each one!

      The magic he possessed wasn't strong, but it seemed to have worked this time.  The sands of time kept trickling down, and he knew that he could no longer linger on this one thing.  The wind and rain had died down, so he cinched his gear and pressed onward into the dark night....
